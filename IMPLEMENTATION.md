# Jira Clone Enhanced Features Implementation

This document provides instructions for setting up and using the new features added to the Jira Clone application:

1. Chat functionality for ticket assignee and creator communication
2. Comments for tickets
3. Analytics for tracking ticket metrics
4. Neon PostgreSQL database integration for web deployment

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup (Neon)

1. Create an account on [Neon](https://neon.tech/) if you don't have one
2. Create a new project and PostgreSQL database
3. Copy your connection string from the Neon dashboard
4. Create a `.env` file in the project root using the `.env.example` as a template
5. Add your Neon database connection strings to both `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL`

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://[username]:[password]@[neon-hostname]/[database]?sslmode=require"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://[username]:[password]@[neon-hostname]/[database]?sslmode=require"
```

### 2. Stream Chat Setup (Optional for Chat Feature)

1. Create an account on [Stream](https://getstream.io/) if you don't have one
2. Create a new app in the Stream dashboard
3. Copy your API Key and Secret
4. Add these to your `.env` file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_STREAM_API_KEY=your_stream_api_key
STREAM_API_SECRET=your_stream_api_secret
```

### 3. Updating the Database Schema

Run the migration script to add the new models to your database:

```bash
node scripts/migrate-db.js
```

This will create the following new models:
- Comment: For issue comments
- ChatConversation: For chat between assignee and reporter  
- ChatMessage: For individual chat messages
- IssueAnalytic: For tracking issue performance metrics

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the new dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
